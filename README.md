# Resources

To complete this project I referred to portions of the following resources:

* [Udacity Restaurant Reviews App Project Resources List](https://www.diigo.com/outliner/fjslyn/Udacity-Restaurant-Reviews-App-(project-%235)?key=zqiopam1yz)

I referred to Udacity's own **Introducing the Service Worker** class for the Service Worker portion of the app, as well as [this](https://bitsofco.de/setting-up-a-basic-service-worker/) for basic review.
